#### Project 4 ❌⭕

## Tic Tac Toe

###### This is the fourth of twelve projects for the 🏡 Treehouse Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

I've aimed for Exceeds Expectations by expanding the project as follows:

- “Player is prompted to enter their name
- Player's name appears on the board screen
- Player vs. computer. One side of the game is programmatically controlled
- Player's name appears if they win
- Tested on Chrome (Version 61.0.3163.91 (Official Build) (64-bit)), Firefox (55.0.3 (64-bit), & Safari (Version 10.1.2 (12603.3.8)).
